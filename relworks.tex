%                       REPLICATED KVS
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{KVS over RDMA}

    \subsection{Kite: efficient and available release consistency for the datacenter}
    This is the real entry paper. This is a replicated KVS over RDMA with \textbf{Release Consistency}.\cite{Gavrielatos-PPoPP-2020} 

    \subsection{FaRM: Fast Remote Memory}
    Super similar to the entry paper in that is is a KVS for RDMA, but this one is I beleive either disaggregated or not. 
    Farm could really be classified as a KVS or even a protocol. This design always replicates state info. 
    Provides \textbf{strict serializability}.\cite{Dragojevic-NSDI-2014}

    \subsection{FaRMv2: Fast General Distributed Transactions with Opacity}
    Just like FaRM but with opacity. Also providing \textbf{strict serializability}.\cite{Shamis-SIGMOD-2019}

    \subsection{HERD: Using RDMA efficiently for key-value services}
    Herd.\cite {Kalia-SIGCOMM-2014}

    \subsection{Sherman }
    This paper \cite{Wang-SIGMOD-2022} is disaggregated. Node-granularity. "consistent".

    \subsection{Pilaf }
    Linearizable data store. Self-correcting

    \subsection{scythe }
    KVS again.

    \subsection{HCL }
    Strictly serializabile KVS

    \subsection{Rolex}
    I don't think this one really works.
%                       DSM OVER RDMA
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section {DSM systems}

    \subsection{Scaling out NUMA-Aware Applications with RDMA-Based Distributed Shared Memory: MAGI}
    Page-based DSM. \cite{Hong-JCST-2019}

    \subsection{Efficient Distributed Memory Management with RDMA and Caching }
    cache-line granularity DSM.\cite{Cai-VLDB-2018}

    \subsection{Distributed Shared Object Memory}
    object based granularity, release consistency... too old for RDMA\cite{Guedes-WWOSIII-1993}

    \subsection{Gengar: An RDMA-based Distributed Hybrid Memory Pool}
    This is object based dsm over rdma but with non-volatile memory as well using Intel Optane. Seems to 
    also use this lease assignment idea like in \cite{Endo-IPDRM-2020} but is not page based.\cite{Duan-ICDCS-2021}

    \subsection{TreadMarks: shared memory computing on networks of workstations}
    Was implemented over IP, lazy release consistency I think. Not sure of granularity yet.\cite{Amza-Usenix-1994}

    \subsection{LITE Kernel RDMA Support for Datacenter Applications}
    This is page based DSM using the kernel. \cite{Tsai-SOSP-2017}

    \subsection{MENPS: A Decentralized Distributed Shared Memory Exploiting RDMA}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Page based DSM
            \item Special Diff merging and page sharing
            \item Combine write notices and logical leases (what is that?)\cite{Endo-IPDRM-2020}
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Argo DSM}
    Page-based DSM again but directory coherence. This was maybe the first RDMA-based DSM paper, 
    at least thats what the authors allude to.\cite{Kaxiras-HPDC-2015}

    \subsection {GiantVM: A Novel Distributed Hypervisor for Resource Aggregation with DSM-aware Optimizations}
    Page-based DSM again but also works over TCP and RDMA\cite{Jia-ACO-2022}

    \subsection{Scalable RDMA performance in PGAS languages}
    This paper is for PGAS languages. Has an address hash table similar to LOCO for remote lookups.\cite{Farreras-IPDPS-2009}

    \subsection{Misc PGAS languages probably}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%                       PROTOCOLS OVER RDMA FOR CONSISTENCY
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Protocols over RDMA for Consistency}

    \subsection{Notes on PGAS and "protocols"}
    It seems like there are not agreed upon semantics on what is a protocol. MPI seems like a protocol but is it? PGAS is a 
    memory model.

    \subsection {Odyssey: The Impact of Modern Hardware on Strongly-Consistent Replication Protocols}
    This paper is a summary of protocols used for RDMA communication. These protocols were used to 
    enforce consistency and were tested with a series of KVSs. This paper is related to Kite (same authors) 
    and Kite is one of the KVSs tested.\cite{Gavrielatos-EuroSys-2021}

    \subsection {Hermes: A Fast, Fault-Tolerant and Linearizable Replication Protocol}
    This paper \cite{Katsarakis-ASPLOS-2020} is one of the Protocols tested by the above paper Odyssey \cite{Gavrielatos-EuroSys-2021}. This 
    protocol guarantees linearizablity and is designed to work on replicated store systems.

    \subsection {Hamband: RDMA Replicated Data Types}
    This paper \cite{Houshmand-PLDI-2022} designed new RDMA data types that are replicated across nodes. This paper 
    is sort of a protocol paper as it implements this protocol to keep replicated data through either relaxed or 'strong consistency'.

    \subsection{Evaluation of RDMA opportunities in an Object-Oriented DSM}
    Interesting result is that it proves that invalidation protocols are better suited 
    for distributed systems. \cite{Veldema-LCPC-2007}

    page based I think (re-read this)\cite{Taranov-ICMD-2021}

    \subsection{Rcmp: Reconstructing RDMA-Based Memory Disaggregation via CXL}
    page based and uses CXL, not comparable\cite{Wang-ACO-2024}
