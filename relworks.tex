\section{Closely Related Works object based / not page-level granularity}
\section {Odyssey: The Impact of Modern Hardware on Strongly-Consistent Replication Protocols}

\section {Hermes: A Fast, Fault-Tolerant and Linearizable Replication Protocol}

\section {Hamband: RDMA Replicated Data Types}

\subsection{Evaluation of RDMA opportunities in an Object-Oriented DSM}
entry paper. Interesting result is that it proves that invalidation protocols are better suited 
for distributed systems. \cite{Veldema-LCPC-2007}

\subsection{FaRM: Fast Remote Memory}
Super similar to the entry paper. A lot of other papers call it DSM so 
I am not totally sure about this. I think this still caches data at the page level.\cite{Dragojevic-NSDI-2014}

\subsection{FaRMv2: Fast General Distributed Transactions with Opacity}
Just like FaRM but with opacity. Also providing strict serializability.\cite{Shamis-SIGMOD-2019}

\subsection{Efficient Distributed Memory Management with RDMA and Caching }
cache-line granularity.\cite{Cai-VLDB-2018}

\subsection{Distributed Shared Object Memory}
object based granularity, release consistency... too old for RDMA\cite{Guedes-WWOSIII-1993}

\subsection{Gengar: An RDMA-based Distributed Hybrid Memory Pool}
This is object based dsm over rdma but with non-volatile memory as well using Intel Optane. Seems to 
also use this lease assignment idea like in \cite{Endo-IPDRM-2020} but is not page based.\cite{Duan-ICDCS-2021}

\subsection{Scalable RDMA performance in PGAS languages}
This paper is for PGAS languages. Has an address hash table similar to LOCO for remote lookups.\cite{Farreras-IPDPS-2009}

\section{Loosely Related but Evaluated}
\subsection{CoRM: Compactable Remote Memory over RDMA}
page based I think (re-read this)\cite{Taranov-ICMD-2021}

\subsection{LITE Kernel RDMA Support for Datacenter Applications}
This is page based DSM using hte kernel. \cite{Tsai-SOSP-2017}

\subsection{MENPS: A Decentralized Distributed Shared Memory Exploiting RDMA}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Page based DSM
    \item Special Diff merging and page sharing
    \item Combine write notices and logical leases (what is that?)\cite{Endo-IPDRM-2020}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scaling out NUMA-Aware Applications with RDMA-Based Distributed Shared Memory: MAGI}
Page-based DSM again. \cite{Hong-JCST-2019}


\subsection {GiantVM: A Novel Distributed Hypervisor for Resource Aggregation with DSM-aware Optimizations}
Page-based DSM again but also works over TCP and RDMA\cite{Jia-ACO-2022}


\subsection{Argo DSM}
Page-based DSM again but directory coherence

\subsection{Rcmp: Reconstructing RDMA-Based Memory Disaggregation via CXL}
page based and uses CXL, not comparable\cite{Wang-ACO-2024}
