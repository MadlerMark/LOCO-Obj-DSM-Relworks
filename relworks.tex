%Loosely Related / Line of Work 
\section{Loosely Related but Evaluated}
\subsection{CoRM: Compactable Remote Memory over RDMA}
page based I think (re-read this)\cite{Taranov-ICMD-2021}


\subsection{FaRM: Fast Remote Memory}
Just like LOCO as we know, but no caching so not really DSM\cite{Dragojevic-NSDI-2014}


\subsection{MENPS: A Decentralized Distributed Shared Memory Exploiting RDMA}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Page based DSM
    \item Special Diff merging and page sharing
    \item Combine write notices and logical leases (what is that?)\cite{Endo-IPDRM-2020}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scaling out NUMA-Aware Applications with RDMA-Based Distributed Shared Memory (MAGI)}
Page-based DSM again\cite{Hong-JCST-2019}


\subsection {GiantVM: A Novel Distributed Hypervisor for Resource Aggregation with DSM-aware Optimizations}
Page-based DSM again but also works over TCP and RDMA\cite{Jia-ACO-2022}


\subsection{Argo DSM}
Page-based DSM again but directory coherence



%------------------------------

%I looked these up but they were too far off to compare at all
\section{Evaluated but not Related}
\subsection{Rcmp: Reconstructing RDMA-Based Memory Disaggregation via CXL}
page based and uses CXL, not comparable\cite{Wang-ACO-2024}
